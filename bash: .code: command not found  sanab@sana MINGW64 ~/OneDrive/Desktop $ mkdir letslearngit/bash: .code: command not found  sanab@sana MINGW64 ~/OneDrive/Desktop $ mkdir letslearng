# game
 hope you gyz really enjoyed  it.  this is my first project  where i had  made a  game to guess the number. 
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>
int main()
{
int nguesses=1,number,guess;
srand(time(0));
number=rand()%100+1; //generate a random number  between 1 and 100
//keep running loop until the number is guessed 
do{
printf("guess the number betweeen 1 and 100\n");
scanf("%d",&guess);
if(guess>number){
printf("lower number please \n");

else if(guess<number){
printf("you guessed it in %d attempts \n",nguesses);
}
nguesses++;
}
while(guess!=number);

return 0;
}
